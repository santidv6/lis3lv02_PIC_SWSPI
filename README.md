# lis3lv02_PIC_SWSPI
A LIS3LV02 accelerometer library for PIC microcontrollers using software SPI
---

This library uses software SPI library from Microchip's PIC18 Peripheral Library (plib).

This library's purpose is to ease the use of ST's LIS3LV02 accelerometer when developing with PIC18F Microcontroller Family using Peripheral Library.
